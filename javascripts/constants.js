// The goal is to keep the values after the ^ operator
// together until the user hits enter. Therefore an operator
// is necessary to represent when the user hits enter so that
// the postfixToKatex function knows to keep everything before the
// enter together.
// I picked a random ascii character to represent enter (a smiley face)! :)
//const enterOperatorChar = "☺"
const invOpenBracket = "☺"; //character for invisible opening bracket '('
const invCloseBracket = "☹";//character for invisible closing bracket ')'

const invisOpenBracket = "☺"; //character for invisible opening bracket '('
const invisCloseBracket = "☹";//character for invisible closing bracket ')'
